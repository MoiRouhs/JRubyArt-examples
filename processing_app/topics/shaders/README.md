## Advanced OpenGL

See processing [wiki](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Advanced-OpenGL)

OpenGL in Processing 3.x, is different from OpenGL in processing-2.2.1. The advanced OpenGL features in 3.x are significantly different from 2.x. Some methods are still regarded as experimental see `advanced_shader.rb` and the associated `glsl` files (_data folder_), use them with the caveat that they may break in future releases of Processing.
