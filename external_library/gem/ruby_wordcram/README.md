### Wordcram

It is unfortunate that there is an original wordcram gem for ruby-processing, so make sure you install the `ruby_wordcram` gem to run these sketches in JRubyArt.  You might want to look at toxiclibs color_utils if you want create a custom `palette` for your  `wordcloud` sketch, for inspiration there are may `wordle` examples out there.
