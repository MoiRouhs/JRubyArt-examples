### Simplex Noise ###

Here we use Karsten Schmidt (_aka toxi, or lately postspectacular_) version of SimplexNoise.  See also Stefan [Stefan Gustavson][simplex] version who created the original java version. This is really educational, rather than serious use in the real world you would target gpu not cpu wouldn't you?
