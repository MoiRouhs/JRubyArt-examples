### About ControlP5 library

This library was developed by [Andreas Schlegel][sojamo] http://www.sojamo.de/ over a number of years (9+) and this is why controlP5's source code so convoluted and bloated see [github][p5]. However this has not deterred people from using the code, and it remains a very popular gui for processing, some of the callback features do not play well with JRubyArt or propane. Here I explore approaches that do work, mainly for use with Thomas Diewalds PixelFlow library (that heavily uses the ControlP5 library).
